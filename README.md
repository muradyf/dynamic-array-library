# Dynamic Array Library
A data structures library implemented in C++ that features a commonly found structure, i.e., dynamic arrays. The library has been designed as my take if I were to design my own library for dynamic arrays. This was an assignment that was assigned to me when I was in my third semester for the course "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)'.
